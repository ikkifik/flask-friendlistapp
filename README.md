This project purpose is to BOOST my learning time, i need to doing it because i want to use Flask as part of my last project for complete my degree. I take a playlist course from codemy.com youtube channel, I like how the host presented the material, he's an excited person. 

Some prerequisite for run this project:
- Flask (of course)
- SQLAlchemy
